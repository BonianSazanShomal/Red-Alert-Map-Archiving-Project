Note: This is a crate map so set starting credits to 0 and sell your MCV at the start of the game. The map is located inside a village with civilians walking around. You are allied to these villagers but you can still kill them by force-firing (hold the Ctrl button and click on a target).

Modifications: Pillbox, Camo-Pillbox, Turret, Flame Turret and Kennel only require a Power Plant to be buildable and are owned by both sides. Grenadier and Dog are buildable by both sides. Flamethrower only requires a Power Plant to be buildable and is also owned by both sides. All the aforementioned are available starting from tech level 1. Every player is allied with the villagers.
