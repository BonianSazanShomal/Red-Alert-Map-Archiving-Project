Here's a basic RA1 MP map i've made. 
It has five players, plenty of ore and gems but mostly.. It has barrels next to some buildings that you can blow up for fun 

I would highly recommend that you do not be gold on this map as you can tell on the first screenie that some of the neutral and special buildings/infantry are gold

Anyway have fun with the map
