This is a project to archive every multiplayer map ever created for Red Alert 1. The main folder layout structure looks like this:

Popular: This folder contains popular maps with lots of variations in them, e.g. P4 or HJK6.  
Alphabetical: Maps without many variations are placed in this folder.  
Uncategorized: Maps that haven't been categorized yet.  

Every map has it's own folder containing the following files:

A .MPR file: This is the actual map file.  
author.txt: If available this file file exists and contains the author's description/comments on the map.  
description.txt: Contains a description of the map featuring info such as map name, size, modifications done to game settings etc..
